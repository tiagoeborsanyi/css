    Ah, it smells like a new challenge!

    This time we build a concept of some job search website.
    It's more about small details this time and if you haven't yet tried splitting
    your css into separate component files - that's the perfect time to try.
    (Use @import in css to achieve that)

    The other gimmick we introduce here is about using font icons instead of inserting images into our code.
    The easiest out-of-the-box method is to use Google Material Icons,
    so read about the implementation before you start:
    https://material.io/icons/

    And good luck!
